# Coin-Toss-Simulator

A program that simulates 10000 iterations of 10 coin tosses within each iteration. 

-> 1 iteration = 10 coin tosses 

I want to find the probability of getting a tails across this distribution. 

Additonally, a histogram is provided, showing the distribution of tails across 10000 iterations. 

Notes: Seed is set to 123, you can choose a separate seed to initialize the random number generator to your specific state for personal reproducibility.
